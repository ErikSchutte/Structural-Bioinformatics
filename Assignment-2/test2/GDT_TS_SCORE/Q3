Global Distance Test (GDT) is a measure that can be used to asses the quality of
protein structure predictions. Given a set of distance thresholds,
GDT maximizes the percentage of superimposed (or matched) residue pairs under
each threshold in each model and target, and reports the average of these
percentages as the final score.

The GDT score is calculated as the largest set of amino acid residues'
alpha carbon atoms in the model structure falling within a defined distance
cutoff of their position in the experimental structure

In general, the higher GDT_TS is, the better a given model
is in comparison to reference structure.


Discrete Optimized Protein Energy (DOPE), is also used as a measure to
assess homology models in protein structure prediction.
The DOPE model score is designed for selecting the best structure from
a collection of models built by MODELLER. The score is unnormalized
with respect to the protein size and has an arbitrary scale, therefore
scores from different proteins cannot be compared directly.

GDT_TS = (GDT_P1 + GDT_P2 + GDT_P4 + GDT_P8)/4.0
where GDT_Pn is an estimation of the percent of residues that can
fit under distance cutoff <= n.0 Angstroms


Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) is popularly used as a measure for
 evaluating models (Arun et al., 1987). However, RMSD measure suffers
 from a few drawbacks.

First, the measure is likely to underestimate the quality of a model where
most of the structure is accurately predicted, but the incorrectly
predicted parts are very far from their correct positions.

In addition to the root
mean squared deviation of the positions of the Ca atoms (Ca-RMSD)

 Both measures are based on the global
distance test (GDT), which determines the number of model-template Caatom
pairs, G(v) that are within a distance threshold, v AËš (39). Using GDT
results, the GDT_TS score (40) is then calculated as the average percentage
of residues that fit within four different cutoff distances:

 When AL0 and GDT_TS scores are used, however,
it is clear that the scores for the whole models are
indeed significantly lower than the scores for the transmembrane
regions (Fig. 2). This suggests that there is a marked
structural variability in the connecting regions between
membrane-spanning segments of topologically related proteins
(i.e., with the same number of transmembrane domains
and the same N- to C-terminal orientations), as indicated by
the variability in their length and sequences.

whereas the GDT_TS
scores for the same regions are often below 100%, suggesting
that the errors in the easier models are local deviations
that might be removed given an effective refinement
protocol.


For the purpose of structure similarity search or ordering of models (or PDB templates),
the target (frame of the reference, second molecule) should be fixed and then user may
sort models (see SUMMARY results) by the number of superimposed residues N (under one
selected DIST cutoff), or by the values of GDT_TS (average from four distance cutoffs),
or LGA_S (weighted results from the full set of distance cutoffs). Let us notice that
LGA_S can be used to evaluate the level of structure similarity between proteins in
sequence dependent ("-3") mode as well as in structure alignment search ("-4") mode.
The experiments show that LGA_S is slightly more sensitive and accurate in scoring
structural similarity than GDT_TS.


    GDT_TS = (GDT_P1 + GDT_P2 + GDT_P4 + GDT_P8)/4.0
      where GDT_Pn is an estimation of the percent of residues that can
      fit under distance cutoff <= n.0 Angstroms

      ./lga model.target -3 -sda -d:4 -swap -gdc_sup:s1:s2 -gdc_set:s5:s6,s7:s8
then the SUMMARY(GDT) results (GDT_TS, LGA_S3, N, ...) will be calculated as before
(using all (in common) amino acids from both structures (model and target)), but the
GDC results (Dist_max and GDC columns in LGA records, and SUMMARY(RMSD_GDC)) will be
calculated for s5:s6,s7:s8 ranges only using the superposition created based on the
amino acids from the range s1:s2.
